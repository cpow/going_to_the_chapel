    <h3>We met at Jimbo's (it was all a dream)</h3>
    <p>
    The story of Meghan and Chris started like most other love stories, at a party at Jimbo's house in Rhode Island. Legend has it that Meghan's sister, Amy, tried to pair Chris and Meghan that night. Unfortunatley that's not how this story ends; however, Jimbo's is only the beginning of Meghan and Chris' story.

    <h3>Move over Virginia, New Hampshire is actually for lovers</h3>
    <p>
    It was a snowy, cold, and dark night in the bitter mountains of New Hampshire. Meghan and Chris went skiing together with a large group of friends. The night of this ski trip is where Meghan and Chris, two people destined for each other, finally fell in love. They spent the night talking about everything, and through this conversation, they realized they couldn't possibly be without each other in life anymore. A few short weeks later it was official, Meghan and Chris were DATING.

    <h3>Oh, the places you'll go</h3>
    <p>
    The relationship between yours truly was filled with many experiences. From getting hit by a car, to moving states away, to moving back to Boston. Meghan and Chris have been everywhere together, enjoying everything life offers -- and experiencing it the way it was meant -- with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
    Meghan is from Connecticut and Chris is from Massachusetts. Thankfully, Meghan's family is a smart group of people, and were fans of all boston's teams. The first few years of there relationship was semi-long distance. Meghan was at school in boston, and Chris worked in Cambridge. This allowed them to see each other at least a few times a week. But the summers were difficult, Meghan returned home to Connecticut, and Chris had to remain in Massachusetts. They saw each other every weekend, never wanting to spend time without the other. They even met halfway sometimes just to have dinner in the middle of the week.

    <p>
    The toughest stage of the relationship was after college. Meghan moved back home to work on the set of the renouned "Jerry Springer Show". Chris still remained in Massachusetts after finding another job in the area. Again, they had to see each other on the weekends, and endure the grind of driving through multiple states just to see each other for fleeting moments, before returning to their weekly lives.

    <h3>The big Move -- Sometimes a failure is an opporunity</h3>
    <p>
    funny thing about opportunity, sometimes its disguised as failure. You see, Chris lost his job (like he has many times before). But this gave yours truly an AMAZING opportunity. Chris took the next job he could in NYC and moved immediately down to Black Rock. Finally, they were together.

      Meghan and Chris enjoyed family, friends, and life together while in Connecticut. They spent two very happy years commuting to NYC, living in Black Rock, and enjoying everything that life had to offer while being togther.

    <h3>Sweet <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Caroline</span> Meghan and Chris</h3>
    <p>
      Meghan and Chris currently live in Boston, and have enjoyed a lot of what life has to offer. They have traveled all around the U.S. (and Meghan to Europe and Africa, but whose counting?) and are really looking forward to the next chapter in their lives.
